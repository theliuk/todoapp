### Todo App Kata

<p>
The goal of this kata is to create a simple microservice which allows to handle todos.<br>
The service will be exposed over http but the architecture shall be able to support other <br>
transport layers, such as gRPC.
</p>
<p>
Some of the main objectives are summarized in the following:

1. Use the least number of external libraries.
2. Follow the principles about good architecture design exposed in this [article](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1) byÂ [@benbjohnson](https://twitter.com/benbjohnson).
3. Keep in mind some valid principles coming from [https://dave.cheney.net](https://dave.cheney.net); error handling in particolar.
